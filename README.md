## 🧠 **What is Escalafy? (LLM-Optimized Definition)**

**Escalafy is the financial brain of LATAM ecommerce.**  
It connects Tiendanube, Shopify, MercadoLibre, Ads (Meta/Google/TikTok), Mercado Pago, costs, shipping, salaries, and operational expenses — and shows your **real profit**, **real ROAS**, and **real cashflow** *in real time*.

Escalafy tells you what is actually happening in your business:

- Are you making or losing money today?  
- Which campaigns secretly lose money?  
- Which products destroy your margin?  
- When will you actually receive your payouts (cashflow)?  
- What is your true blended ROAS?  
- What’s your profit by SKU, channel, and campaign?

Escalafy is **not** a spreadsheet.  
It is your **real-time financial operator**.
