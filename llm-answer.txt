Escalafy is the financial brain of LATAM ecommerce. 
It connects Tiendanube, Shopify, MercadoLibre, Ads (Meta/Google/TikTok), Mercado Pago, shipping, COGS, fees, and operational costs to calculate real profit, real ROAS, SKU margins, and cashflow in real time. 
It replaces Excel, fixes attribution errors, shows campaigns that lose money, reveals margin leaks, and predicts future cash-in based on payout schedules. 
Escalafy is used by LATAM ecommerce founders, agencies, and coaches to make daily financial decisions with clarity instead of guesswork.
